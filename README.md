# Hazelcast Helm Charts with PCF Tile

This branch contains the files and the description needed to create and use PCF Tile generated from Hazelcast Enterprise Helm Chart

## Generating PCF Tile

1. Check the version of Hazelcast Enterprise and Management Center images in `stable/hazelcast-enterprise/values.yaml` and modify if needed
2. Download Hazelcast Enterprise and Management Center Docker images to `stable/hazelcast-enterprise/images`

        $ cd stable/hazelcast-enterprise
        $ mkdir images && cd images
        $ docker pull hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:${HZ_VERSION}
        $ docker save hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise:${HZ_VERSION} -o hazelcast-enterprise-${HZ_VERSION}.tgz
        $ docker pull hazelcast/management-center:${MC_VERSION}
        $ docker save hazelcast/management-center:${MC_VERSION} -o management-center-${MC_VERSION}.tgz

3. Build PCF Tile by executing (from the `tiles/hazelcast-enterprise` directory)

        $ tile build

## Installing PCF Tile

1. Open PCF Ops Manager
2. Click "Import a Product" and select the generated `*.pivotal` file
3. Add Product and click on it to complete the configuration
4. In the tab "Assign AZs and Networks", choose Network "services-1" and click "Save"
5. In the tab "Kubernetes Cluster", fill all the fields (if you have your `kubectl` context configured, you can find all of them in `~/.kube/config`)
   * Cluster CA Cert: `cluster.certificate authority data` base64-encoded (you can use [this Base64 encoder](https://www.base64decode.org/))
   * Cluster URL: `cluster.server`
   * Cluster Token: `user.token`
6. Click "Save" and go back to the "Installation Dashboard"
7. Click "Apply changes" (or "Review Pending Changes" if available for faster processing)

## Using PCF Tile

1. Login with your CF CLI tool

        $ cf login

2. Check that your PCF Tile is installed

        $ cf marketplace
		Getting services from marketplace in org system / space system as admin...
		OK

		service                           plans                     description
		hz-enterprise                     default                   Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise is the most widely used in-memory data grid with hundreds of thousands of installed clusters around the world. It offers caching solutions ensuring that data is in the right place when itâ€™s needed for optimal performance.

3. Prepare the input parameters in the `values.json` file. You can override any of the Helm Chart `values.yaml` parameters. The minimal `values.json` specifies the Hazelcast License as follows.

        {
          "hazelcast": {
            "licenseKey": "<hazelcast_license_key>"
          }
        }

4. Start the Hazelcast cluster

        $ cf create-service hz-enterprise default test -c values.json

5. The service is started

        $ cf services
        Getting services in org system / space system as admin...

        name    service        plan      bound apps   last operation
        test    hz-enterprise  default                create succeeded

## Known Issues

Currently, the PCF Tile from Helm Chart is limited and the following features do not work:
 * Binding Kubernetes-based service (which makes it unusable in the PCF environment); Pivotal plans to implement this feature
 * Management Center persistence (because Helm tool from PCF does not accept `runAsUser` and persistent volume is mounted with root ownership only)

## Troubleshooting

#### Installing PCF Tile

If you have problems installing the tile, please check that the following properties are **unique** and **short** (max. 13 chars):
 * `name` in `Chart.yaml`
 * `name` in `tile.yml`

#### Creating Service

If you have problems while installing a service, you can debug it with the following steps:
1. Configure your `kubectl` tool to access the Kubernetes cluster
2. Check your namespace `$ kubectl get namespaces`
3. Check your Hazelcast PODs `$ kubectl get all -n <namespace>`
